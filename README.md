# BackEndCode-Priya


INSTALLATION AND SETUP:

•	Installation and Environment setup.

•	Upgraded pip and installed necessary libraries:typing-extensions,tensorflow-probability and openai.

•	OpenAI API Integration.

•	Set the OpenAI API key using openai.api_key.

•	Imported the openai library.

•	Defined a function generate_chat_completion that takes a prompt as input.

•	Uses the ChatCompletion.create endpoint with gpt-3.5-turbo model.

•	Extracts the generated text from the API response.

•	Returns the generated text.

•	Demonstrates calling the function with a sample prompt about metaverse technology.

•	Prints the generated response from the OpenAI API.

•	Interacts with the OpenAI API to create chat-like responses based on user prompts.

•	Demonstrates a basic example of OpenAI API integration for text generation.

•	Consider error handling and input validation for robustness.

•	Explore different language models and parameters for diverse responses.

•	Implement more complex conversation flows for engaging interactive experiences.





CONVERTING THE RESPONSE TO SPEECH:


•	The code aims to showcase a chat-based interaction with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.

•	It generates a response based on a user prompt and utilizes the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library to convert the response into speech.

•	`openai`: Used for interacting with the OpenAI API and generating chat-based completions.

•	`gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech): Utilized for converting text to speech.

•	The OpenAI API key is set using `openai.api_key`.

•	Takes a user prompt as input.

•	Uses the GPT-3.5-turbo model for creating a chat-based completion.

•	The conversation structure includes a system message ("You are a helpful assistant.") and a user message with the provided prompt.

•	Extracts the generated text from the API response.

•	Takes a text input and an optional filename for the output.

•	Utilizes gTTS to transform the text into an MP3 audio file.

•	Saves the generated audio file with the specified filename.

•	Uses the `os.system` command to play the audio file, employing the `afplay` command (adjustable based on the operating system).

•	An example prompt is provided: "tell me a joke."Calls the function to obtain a response from the GPT-3.5-turbo model.Prints the generated response.Calls the function to convert the response to speech and plays it using the `afplay` command.





FUNCTION TO CREATE A VIDEO:


•	Takes the path of an image, path of an audio file, and an optional output path for the video.

•	Creates an image clip with a specified duration (5 seconds in this case).

•	Loads an audio clip from the provided audio file path.

•	Ensures both clips have the same duration by trimming them if necessary.

•	Combines the image clip with the audio clip to create a final video clip.

•	Writes the final video to the specified output path in MP4 format with H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec.
